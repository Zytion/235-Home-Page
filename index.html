                    I am Bobby Levin, a second year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institue and
                    Technology.<br><br>
                    I enjoy playing the trumpet, sailing, and playing video games.
                    My favorite video game is <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</i>
                    and my favorite song is <i>Getaway</i> by Earth, Wind, & Fire. <br><br>
                    This is my website for IGME-235: Intro to Game Web Tech.
                    For this class, I want to learn HTML and CSS coding conventions and learn how to code in
                    Javasript.<br><br>
                    I am hoping to minor in Computer Science and focus my education around the programming and
                    management sides of video game devlopment.<br><br>
                    My dream is to get a job in the gamification industry and promote the use of video games as an
                    educational tool.
